        <h3>Hi, {user}</h3>
        <p style="margin: 15px 15px;">
          We're excited to have you as a part of our community! You can now complete your
          profile and submit quotes to open jobs on our site.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 15px 15px;">
          We don't want to put limits on how you work, so we really just have two basic rules
          you have to be hired and paid on VendorForest.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 15px 15px;">
          Protect your time and effort wait until you're hired and the job's escrow account is
          funded before you start working.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 15px 15px;">
          After each milestone you can then request the payment to be released from your client.
        </p>
