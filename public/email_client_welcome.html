        <h3>Hi, {user}</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to VendorForest! We are thrilled to have you as a client!<br />
          Get started in three easy steps:<br />
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p style="margin: 15px; padding: 0;">
              <b>Activate your account.</b>
              {url}
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p style="margin: 15px; padding: 0;">
              <b>Post your first job.</b>
              Describe the work you need done, and set a budget and timeline.<br />
              <a href="#">Post a Job</a>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Find and hire the best vendor(s).</b>
              Browse the services provided by our world-class vendors. You can invite vendors to
              apply or simply sit back and wait for them to apply or bid. Review their quotes,
              feedback and work portfolio to select the best.<br />
              <a href="#">Find Vendors</a>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once you've hired a vendor, we provide services to help you protect your job and
          money.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Pay VendorForest risk-Free.</b><br />
              SafePay offers a payment protection guarantee. You deposit your payment in in our
              secured escrow account, and then you pay your vendor when they request a payment
              to be released to them, but only after you approve their work. We have put all the
              powers in your hand just like it supposed to be.<br />
